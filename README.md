# Presentation
This public repository github shows some of my personal work done during my gap year at the University of Michigan.\
You can find a code for training and predicting landmark identification for Intra Oral Scan, and a code for training and predicting crown segmentation for Intral Oral Scan. These codes are just a refactoring to train myself with pytorch3D, Pytorch, Pytorch-Lightning.\
In the Palate folder you can find all the codes I have written for my research. Actually the codes are not commented, documented and cleaned. These codes are there to show what I can do.


# Landmark folder
The landmark folder contains the refactoring code of the training and prediction landmark identification. \
The aim of this refactoring is to clean a little a bit the main code, and change the training from pytorch to pytorch-lightning. \
The main code is available in this [repository](https://github.com/HUTIN1/ALIDDM) 


# SegmentationTeeth
SegmentaitonTeeht folder contain the refactoring code of the training and prediction segmentation of the dental crown.\
The aim of this refactoring is to clean a little a bit the code, and change the training from pytorch to pytorch-lightning. \
The main code was available in this [repository](https://github.com/HUTIN1/fly-by-cnn/tree/master/src/py/challenge-teeth)

# Palate
Palete folder contain the scrips used to find method to do the automatic registration.
